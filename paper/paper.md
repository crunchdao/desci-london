## 1. Machine Learning and Dynamical Systems: Supervised Learning

We have noisy observations associated with a deterministic dynamical system and we are interested in best fitting, in some sense, these high-dimensional observations with a target scalar observation, related to the same system.

See [@nateghi2022] and [@Champion_2019] for additional context. 

## 2. Convex Optimization

The estimated targets are part of a pipeline sending them to a convex optimizer which returns a fitness different from your fitness. You cannot modify the convex optimizer.

See [@cvxpy] for additional context.

## 3. Chaos

Following the methodology discussed in https://desci.crunchdao.com/projects/unipi/stochastic-chaos BIBITEM missing, it is possible to use the tools of chaos theory in order to investigate the existance of coherent structures in the underlying dynamical system FROYLAND BIBITEM MISSING HERE.

In particular, the use of IPFS enables the integration of [multimedia contents](https://gateway.crunchdao.com/ipfs/QmRPq1NZWCsTgrfZNVQpFohbgk2hvxGZE6oV6fexeqK5Px) in this work, accessible both from the paper and from the source code.
